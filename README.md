# typing-speed-test

This is a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) application which records typing speed of the user in Words per Minute (WPM). The application randomizes text from text.txt file and measures typing speed in runtime. The test is successful only if the user enters the exact text match, hence mistakes are NOT ignored.

## How to use
Download and extract this repository in a folder. Open any terminal application and navigate to that folder. Run main.py file in Python 3.x. Press escape to exit.

Add new lines in text.txt to customise test.
